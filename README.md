# Installation

# Linux

The installation is pretty simple. To install this tool on Linux, you git clone this repository like this: ``git clone https://github.com/BillySap12/FSociety-Tool``. If for some reason your Linux does not have git pre-installed, you can simply install git using ``sudo apt install git`` and then git cloning this repository. 

After you have done that, go into the directory made by doing ``cd FSociety-Tool``. 

Once you have navigated into the directory, install all the requirements by doing ``pip -r install requirements.txt``.

Now run the program by doing ``python3 main.py``. 

# Windows & MacOS

For Windows or Mac, go to the repository (https://github.com/BillySap12/FSociety-Tool). 

There should be a green button that says "Code". 

Click on it, and then press the "Download ZIP" button. 

Wait for it to download.

Once it has downloaded, go to the directory where it was downloaded.
Extract all of it's components.

Open your cmd, and write the following: ``cd path/where/the/zip/got/downloaded``.

Once you have done that, run: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.

Wait for them to download.

Now, go back to your File Explorer, and double click on the ``main.py`` file. 

That should run the program.

# Recommendation

I recommend you to use Linux, in particular Kali Linux, but it should work fine on almost all other OSes.
